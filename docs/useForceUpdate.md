# `useForceUpdate` Hook

## Description

`useForceUpdate` is a custom React hook that provides a function to force a component to re-render. This is rarely needed in React applications, as state and prop changes should handle most re-rendering scenarios. However, it can be useful in specific situations where you need to trigger an update manually.

## Description

The `useForceUpdate` hook returns a single function. Calling this function will force the component to re-render.
