## React Hook Migration Task List

This task list outlines the process for migrating React hooks from the `./new` folder to the `./src` folder, ensuring quality and efficiency.

- [ ] **Preparation (One-Time Setup)**
  - [ ] Review all files in the `./new` folder for potential copyright issues and note them.
  - [ ] Identify and list any external libraries required by the hooks in `./new`.
  - [ ] Install all required external libraries listed.
  - [ ] Ensure `npm run build` runs without error before starting the hook migration.
  - [ ] Create a backup branch before starting the migration.
- [ ] **Hook Migration (Repeat for Each Hook)**
  - [ ] **Select Hook:** Choose one hook from the `./new` folder.
  - [ ] **Copyright Check:** Review any copyright issues that may be present in the hook being migrated. If copyright or licensing is problematic, the hook should be discarded.
  - [ ] **Import Review:** Examine the hook's code to identify all imported code from other files.
  - [ ] **Code Consolidation:** Merge all imported code into the hook's primary file within the `./new` directory.
  - [ ] **File Creation:** Create a new file for the hook in the `./src/hooks` folder. Name the file `use[HookName].ts` (e.g., `useMyHook.ts`).
  - [ ] **Code Transfer:** Copy the consolidated code into the new file.
  - [ ] **Import Adjustments:** Update the imports within the hook's file to reflect its new location.
  - [ ] **Build Check:** Run `npm run build` to check for type errors and code issues. If build fails fix the hook, and run again.
  - [ ] **Index Update:** Add an export statement for the new hook in `src/index.ts`.
  - [ ] **Documentation:** Create a README file for the hook in the `./docs` folder. Name it `use[HookName].md`.
    - [ ] Include a concise description of the hook's functionality.
    - [ ] Provide usage examples with code snippets.
    - [ ] Explain parameters and return values.
  - [ ] **Commit Preparation:** Stage the changes (new hook file, updated `index.ts`, documentation).
- [ ] **Post-Migration (After Each Hook)**
  - [ ] **Version Increment:** Increment the version number in `package.json` (e.g., "0.5.0" to "0.6.0").
  - [ ] **Commit:** Create a descriptive commit message (e.g., "feat: Migrate useMyHook to src").
  - [ ] **Push:** Push the commit to the remote repository.
- [ ] **Repeat**
  - [ ] Repeat the Hook Migration for all hooks until all are moved.
- [ ] **Final**
  - [ ] Delete the `./new` directory and its contents.
  - [ ] Create a final commit and push.
