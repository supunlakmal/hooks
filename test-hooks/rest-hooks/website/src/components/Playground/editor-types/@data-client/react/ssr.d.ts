 *
 * Actions must have a `type` field that indicates the type of action being
 * performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another
 * module. These must be strings, as strings are serializable.
 *

 * The base dispatch function *always* synchronously sends an action to the

 * calculate a new state. It expects actions to be plain objects ready to be
 * consumed by the reducer.

   * will use a more recent snapshot of the subscription list.

   * 2. The listener should not expect to see all states changes, as the state
   * might have been updated multiple times during a nested `dispatch()` before
   * the listener is called. It is, however, guaranteed that all subscribers
   * registered before the `dispatch()` started will be called with the latest
